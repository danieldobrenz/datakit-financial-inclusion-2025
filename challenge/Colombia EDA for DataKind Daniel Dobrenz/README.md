This folder contains my analysis of Colombias Financial Inclusion Data. It's an analysis of the gender differences and income levels compared to region and institutions. Hopefully, this will help target opportunities for financial projects to people who don't normally have access to them. 

I've included my translation from Spanish to English notebook as well. I only translated the columns, everything other than the columns I left untouched. They are the names of regions and banks. No reason to translate them. 

Also, included are SOME of the visualizations, but not ALL.
